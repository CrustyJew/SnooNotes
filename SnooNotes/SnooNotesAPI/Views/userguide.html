<h3>Work in progress, please wear hard hats</h3>
<p>After installing the addon, you may need to refresh your Reddit page if you had it open when you installed. You will also need to login by looking for the text '[SN Login]' located next to your modmail icon. If you want to be able to import notes from Moderator ToolBox, please remember to check the "Wiki" optional permission. If you are activating a private subreddit, please make sure <strong>at least one</strong> account has the optional "read" permission checked at all times. Without the read permission, SnooNotes will not be able to sync mod permissions correctly and the mod list might not be updated on a regular basis.
 </p>
<p>Opening Reddit for the first time may currently cause a slightly delay in SnooNotes becoming available, hopefully this will be optimized further soon.</p>

<p>After SnooNotes has loaded, look for text next to a user's name that says '[Add Note]' or '[View Notes]' depending on whether the user has any notes or not. This text will only show up next to users on comments / posts in a subreddit that has been activated for SnooNotes.</p>
<p>To activate a subreddit for SnooNotes, next to the modmail icon, look for text that says '[SN Options]'. Select the subreddit you want to activate from the drop down (only subreddits that you have "Full" permissions on will show up in this list), and click "Activate". SnooNotes will start you out with the same default note types as Moderator ToolBox has for user notes.</p>
<p>In your options panel, you can change the permissions for activated subreddits. Any moderator with "Full" permissions will always have access to change these settings as well as access to SnooNotes. If no checkboxes are ticked, then any moderator (even one with no permissions) will have access to view and add SnooNotes. If at least one checkbox is ticked, than only moderators that have at least one of the checked access roles will have permission to view SnooNotes.</p>
<p>You can also change note types from this options menu. You can choose whether they are bold or italic based on the checkboxes. The color code supports any 3 or 6 digit, hexadecimal code (<strong>do not include the hashtag!</strong>)</p>
